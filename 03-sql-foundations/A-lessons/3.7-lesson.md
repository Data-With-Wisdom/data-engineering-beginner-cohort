## 🔹 Lesson 3.7 — GROUP BY

`GROUP BY` lets you aggregate data **by category**. Instead of one total, you get totals *per group*.

### Example

```sql
-- How many customers are in each city?
SELECT city, COUNT(*) AS total_customers
FROM customers
GROUP BY city;
```

**Result:**

| city   | total_customers |
|--------|----------------|
| Lagos  | 120            |
| Abuja  | 85             |
| Kano   | 43             |

### Another Example

```sql
-- Total sales per product
SELECT product_name, SUM(amount) AS total_sales
FROM orders
GROUP BY product_name
ORDER BY total_sales DESC;
```

> 💡 **Rule to remember:** Any column in your `SELECT` that is **not** inside an aggregation function **must** be in the `GROUP BY`.
