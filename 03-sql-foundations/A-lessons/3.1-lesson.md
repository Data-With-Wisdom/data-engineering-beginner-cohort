# Lesson 3.1: What is SQL and Types of SQL

## What is SQL?

**SQL = Structured Query Language**

**Simple definition:** The language used to communicate with databases.

**What SQL lets you do:**
- Query data (ask questions like "Show me all customers from Lagos")
- Insert data (add new records)
- Update data (change existing records)
- Delete data (remove records)
- Create tables (define data structure)
- Manage databases (users, permissions, backups)

**Think of it as:** The universal language that all relational databases understand.

## Why SQL Matters for Data Engineers

**SQL is THE most important skill in data engineering.**

Here's what you'll do with SQL in real data engineering work:

- Extract data from production databases for analysis
- Transform data (clean, aggregate, join tables)
- Load data into data warehouses
- Write data quality checks (validate data is correct)
- Build analytics tables (create summary views)
- Debug pipelines (investigate why data looks wrong)
- Optimize queries (make slow queries fast)

**Job market reality:**
- 95%+ of Data Engineer jobs require SQL
- SQL is the #1 skill across all data roles (DE, DA, DS)
- You cannot be a data engineer without knowing SQL

## SQL is Declarative, Not Imperative

This is a key concept that makes SQL different from programming languages like Python or Java.

### What does "declarative" mean?

**Declarative (SQL):** You describe WHAT you want, not HOW to get it.

```sql
-- SQL: "Give me all customers from Lagos"
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE city = 'Lagos';
```

The database figures out the most efficient way to find those customers.

**Imperative (Python):** You describe HOW to do it, step by step.

```python
# Python: You write every step of the logic
lagos_customers = []
for customer in all_customers:
    if customer['city'] == 'Lagos':
        lagos_customers.append(customer)
return lagos_customers
```

### Why does this matter?

**SQL is optimized automatically:**
- The database has a query optimizer that chooses the fastest execution plan
- It considers indexes, statistics, and available memory
- You write simple SQL, database handles complexity

**Python requires manual optimization:**
- You write the exact logic
- If it's slow, you rewrite it
- You manage memory, loops, and efficiency

## ANSI SQL: The Universal Standard

### What is ANSI SQL?

**ANSI SQL** = American National Standards Institute SQL

**What it is:**
- The official international standard for SQL
- Core commands that work across all database systems
- The "common ground" every database vendor agrees to support

**Examples of ANSI SQL (works everywhere):**

```sql
SELECT name, email FROM customers;
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE amount > 50000;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM products GROUP BY category;
```

### Core ANSI SQL Commands

**Data Query Language (DQL):**
- `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `JOIN`

**Data Manipulation Language (DML):**
- `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`

**Data Definition Language (DDL):**
- `CREATE TABLE`, `ALTER TABLE`, `DROP TABLE`

## SQL Flavors (Dialects)

While ANSI SQL is the standard, each database vendor adds proprietary extensions.

Common flavors include PostgreSQL SQL, MySQL, T-SQL (SQL Server), PL/SQL (Oracle), SQLite SQL, Snowflake SQL, and BigQuery SQL.

### What is the same across flavors?

About 95%: core querying, filtering, sorting, aggregations, joins, data types, and basic DDL/DML.

### What is different across flavors?

About 5%: syntax variations for operations like limiting rows, string concatenation, date functions, and case-insensitive matching.

## Why We're Using PostgreSQL

1. Industry standard in many modern data teams
2. Very close to ANSI SQL
3. Free and open source
4. Strong transfer to cloud warehouse SQL patterns
5. Excellent documentation

---

## Key Takeaways

1. SQL is declarative: say WHAT you want
2. ANSI SQL is the cross-database standard
3. Dialect differences are usually minor
4. PostgreSQL is a strong starting point
5. Core SQL skills transfer across databases
