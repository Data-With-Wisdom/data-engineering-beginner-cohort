## 🔹 Lesson 3.6 — Aggregations: COUNT, SUM, AVG

Aggregation functions **summarize** your data. Instead of seeing every row, you get one result.

---

### COUNT — How many rows?

```sql
-- How many customers do we have?
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customers;

-- How many customers are from Lagos?
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customers
WHERE city = 'Lagos';
```

---

### SUM — Add up values

```sql
-- Total revenue from all orders
SELECT SUM(amount) FROM orders;
```

---

### AVG — Calculate the average

```sql
-- Average order amount
SELECT AVG(amount) FROM orders;
```

---

### Other useful ones

```sql
SELECT MAX(amount) FROM orders;  -- Highest order
SELECT MIN(amount) FROM orders;  -- Lowest order
```
