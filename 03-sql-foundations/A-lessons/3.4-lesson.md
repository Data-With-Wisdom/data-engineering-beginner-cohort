## 🔹 Lesson 3.4 — SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, LIMIT

These are the most common SQL commands you'll use every single day.

---

### SELECT — Retrieve Data

```sql
-- Get everything from the table
SELECT * FROM customers;

-- Get only specific columns
SELECT name, city FROM customers;
```

`*` means "all columns". Be specific when you can — it's faster and cleaner.

---

### WHERE — Filter Rows

```sql
-- Only customers from Lagos
SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE city = 'Lagos';

-- Only customers who signed up after 2023
SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE signup_date > '2023-01-01';
```

The `WHERE` clause tells SQL **which rows** to return.

---

### ORDER BY — Sort Results

```sql
-- Sort by name A to Z
SELECT * FROM customers
ORDER BY name ASC;

-- Sort by signup date, newest first
SELECT * FROM customers
ORDER BY signup_date DESC;
```

- `ASC` = Ascending (A→Z, 1→10) ← default
- `DESC` = Descending (Z→A, 10→1)

---

### LIMIT — Control How Many Rows You Get

```sql
-- Only show the first 5 rows
SELECT * FROM customers
LIMIT 5;
```

> 💡 Always use `LIMIT` when exploring a new table — it prevents accidentally loading millions of rows.

---

### Putting It All Together

```sql
SELECT name, city, signup_date
FROM customers
WHERE city = 'Lagos'
ORDER BY signup_date DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**In plain English:** *"Show me the name, city, and signup date of customers from Lagos, ordered from newest to oldest, but only the top 10."*
