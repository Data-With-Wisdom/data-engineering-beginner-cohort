## 🔹 Lesson 3.2 — Database Fundamentals

### What is a Database?

A **database** is an organized collection of data stored electronically. Instead of saving data in random files, a database stores it in a structured way so you can easily search, update, and retrieve it.

**Real-life example:** Think of your phone contacts. All names, numbers, and emails are stored in an organized way — that's a simple database.

### Types of Databases: Relational vs Non-Relational

| Feature | Relational (SQL) | Non-Relational (NoSQL) |
|--------|-----------------|----------------------|
| Structure | Tables (rows & columns) | Documents, key-value, graphs |
| Language | SQL | Varies (JSON, etc.) |
| Examples | PostgreSQL, MySQL | MongoDB, Redis |
| Best for | Structured, consistent data | Flexible or unstructured data |

> 💡 As a **data engineer**, you'll work with both **relational databases** and **Non-Relational (NoSQL)**.

### What is a Relational Database?

A **relational database** stores data in **tables** that are **linked (related) to each other**.

**Example:** A `customers` table and an `orders` table can be related, every order belongs to a customer.

---

### What is an RDBMS?

**RDBMS** = **Relational Database Management System**

It's the software that manages your relational database. It lets you create databases, run SQL queries, and manage your data safely.

**Examples of RDBMS:**
- PostgreSQL ✅ *(what we use in this course)*
- MySQL
- SQLite
- Microsoft SQL Server

---

### What is a Database Engine?

A **database engine** is the core part of the RDBMS that actually **reads, writes, and processes** your data. You don't interact with it directly — it works behind the scenes when you run a SQL query.

---

### What is a Table?

A **table** is where data lives in a relational database. It looks just like a spreadsheet — with **rows** and **columns**.

**Example — `employees` table:**

| employee_id | name    | department | salary |
|-------------|---------|------------|--------|
| 1           | Ada     | Finance    | 80000  |
| 2           | Chidi   | Marketing  | 65000  |
| 3           | Ngozi   | Finance    | 72000  |

---

### Rows vs Columns

- A **column** = a **field** or **attribute** (e.g., `name`, `salary`) — it defines what type of data is stored
- A **row** = a **record** (e.g., one employee's full details) — it's one entry in the table

---

### What is a Primary Key?

A **Primary Key** is a column that **uniquely identifies each row** in a table. No two rows can have the same primary key value, and it can never be empty.

In our example above, `employee_id` is the primary key — every employee has a unique ID.

---

### How Relational Data is Structured

In relational databases, tables are connected through **keys**. One table can reference another using a **Foreign Key** — a column that points to the primary key of another table.

**Example:**

`orders` table has a `customer_id` column → this references `customers.customer_id`

This relationship is what makes the database **relational**.
