## 🔹 Lesson 3.9 — INNER JOIN and LEFT JOIN

Joins allow you to **combine data from two tables** into one result.

---

### INNER JOIN — Only matching rows from both tables

```sql
SELECT c.name, o.product_name, o.amount
FROM customers c
INNER JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;
```

**What this returns:** Only customers who **have** placed an order. Customers with no orders are excluded.

---

### LEFT JOIN — All rows from the left table, even if no match

```sql
SELECT c.name, o.product_name, o.amount
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;
```

**What this returns:** All customers — even those who haven't placed an order. For customers with no orders, the order columns will show `NULL`.

### Visual Comparison

```
customers table:    orders table:
Ada   (id=1)        id=1 → Ada's order
Chidi (id=2)        id=1 → Ada's second order
Ngozi (id=3)        (no orders for Chidi or Ngozi)

INNER JOIN result:        LEFT JOIN result:
Ada   → order 1           Ada   → order 1
Ada   → order 2           Ada   → order 2
                          Chidi → NULL
                          Ngozi → NULL
```

> 💡 Use **INNER JOIN** when you only care about records that exist in both tables. Use **LEFT JOIN** when you want to keep all records from the first (left) table regardless.

### Using Aliases for Cleaner Queries

`c` and `o` are **aliases** — short names for the tables. This makes queries much easier to read, especially when joining multiple tables.
