## 🔹 Lesson 3.5 — Filtering: AND / OR / IN

### AND — All conditions must be true

```sql
SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE city = 'Lagos'
AND signup_date > '2023-01-01';
```

Returns customers who are **both** from Lagos **and** signed up after 2023.

---

### OR — At least one condition must be true

```sql
SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE city = 'Lagos'
OR city = 'Abuja';
```

Returns customers from Lagos **or** Abuja (or both).

---

### IN — Match any value in a list

```sql
SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE city IN ('Lagos', 'Abuja', 'Kano');
```

This is a cleaner way to write multiple `OR` conditions. Same result, less code.

---

### Combining Filters

```sql
SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE city IN ('Lagos', 'Abuja')
AND signup_date > '2023-01-01';
```

> 💡 Use parentheses when mixing `AND` and `OR` to avoid confusion:
> ```sql
> WHERE (city = 'Lagos' OR city = 'Abuja') AND signup_date > '2023-01-01'
> ```
