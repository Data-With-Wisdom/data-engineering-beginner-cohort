**Question 1:** How many customers do we have in total?

**Question 2:** Which city has the most customers?

**Question 3:** What is the total revenue generated from all orders?

**Question 4:** Who are the top 5 customers by total amount spent?

**Question 5:** How many customers have never placed an order?

For each question, provide:

1. Your **SQL query**
2. A **plain English explanation** of what the query does

### Example Submission (for guidance)

**Question:** What is the total revenue from orders placed by Lagos customers?

**SQL:**
```sql
SELECT SUM(o.amount) AS total_revenue
FROM orders o
INNER JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
WHERE c.city = 'Lagos';
```

**Explanation:** This query joins the orders and customers tables, filters for Lagos customers only, and adds up all their order amounts.

**Interpretation:** Lagos customers generated ₦4.5M in total revenue, making it our highest-performing city.

> 🎯 **Key Mindset Reminder:**
> SQL is not about memorizing syntax. It's about asking the right questions and letting the data tell you the story.
