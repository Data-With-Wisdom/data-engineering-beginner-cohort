# Activity 3.2: Practice Exercise

## Practice Exercise

Before the next lesson, practice these tasks:

**Task 1:** Create a table called `products`
```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
    product_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    product_name VARCHAR(100),
    price DECIMAL(10, 2),
    stock_quantity INT
);
```

**Task 2:** Insert 3 products
```sql
INSERT INTO products (product_name, price, stock_quantity)
VALUES 
    ('Laptop', 500000.00, 10),
    ('Mouse', 5000.00, 50),
    ('Keyboard', 15000.00, 30);
```

**Task 3:** Query all products
```sql
SELECT * FROM products;
```

**Task 4:** Find products cheaper than ₦20,000
```sql
SELECT * FROM products WHERE price < 20000;
```

**If all 4 tasks work, you're ready for the next lesson!**

**Next Lesson:** We'll dive deep into SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, and LIMIT - the foundation of all SQL querying!
