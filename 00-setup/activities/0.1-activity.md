# Activity 0.1: Python Installation, Setup, and Verification

**Goal:** Install Python and confirm it runs on your machine.  
**Estimated time:** 20-30 minutes

## Step 1: Download Python
- Go to the official Python downloads page and choose the latest stable version:
  - [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## Step 2: Install Python
### Windows
1. Run the installer.
2. Check **"Add Python to PATH"** on the first screen.
3. Click **Install Now**.

### macOS
1. Run the installer package.
2. Follow the prompts to complete installation.

## Step 3: Verify the Installation
Open a terminal and run:

```bash
python --version
```

If that does not work on Windows, try:

```bash
py --version
```

You should see a Python version number (for example, `Python 3.12.x`).

## Step 4: Run a Quick Test
In the terminal, run:

```bash
python -c "print('hello, data engineering!')"
```

## Troubleshooting
- If the command is not found, restart your terminal and try again.
- If Windows still does not find Python, reinstall and make sure **"Add Python to PATH"** is checked.
- If you have multiple versions, use `py --version` and `py -3 --version` to confirm the default.

## Deliverable
- Paste a screenshot or the terminal output showing your Python version and the test message.
