## **Lesson 1.2: Roles in Data Teams**

### **The Four Main Roles:**

#### **1. Data Engineer (DE)**
**What they do:** Build and maintain data infrastructure

**Daily tasks:**
- Write code to move data between systems
- Design databases, data warehouses, data lakehouses
- Build automated data pipelines
- Monitor data quality
- Optimize query performance

**Tools they use:** SQL, Python, Apache Spark, Airflow, cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, and Azure)

**Analogy:** The construction worker who builds the roads and bridges

---

#### **2. Data Analyst (DA)**
**What they do:** Answer business questions using data

**Daily tasks:**
- Write SQL queries to extract insights
- Create dashboards and reports
- Analyze trends (sales going up? customer churn increasing?)
- Present findings to stakeholders

**Tools they use:** SQL, Excel, Tableau, Power BI, Python (basic)

**Analogy:** The detective who investigates and reports findings

---

#### **3. Data Scientist (DS)**
**What they do:** Build predictive models and algorithms

**Daily tasks:**
- Develop machine learning models (predict customer churn, recommend products)
- Run statistical experiments
- Build algorithms
- Test hypotheses

**Tools they use:** Python (pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow), R, SQL

**Analogy:** The scientist in the lab running experiments

---

#### **4. Analytics Engineer**
**What they do:** Bridge between DE and DA (newer role)

**Daily tasks:**
- Transform raw data into clean, analysis-ready datasets
- Write data transformation code (SQL + dbt)
- Document data definitions
- Ensure data consistency

**Tools they use:** SQL, dbt, version control

**Analogy:** The translator who makes engineer's work usable for analysts
