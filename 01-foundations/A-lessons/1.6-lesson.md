## **Lesson 1.6: Day in the Life of a Data Engineer**

### **Morning (9 AM - 12 PM):**
- Check MS Teams - any data pipeline failures overnight?
- Review monitoring dashboard - are all pipelines running?
- Debug why yesterday's sales report has missing data
- Fix broken pipeline (a schema changed in the source database)
- Re-run pipeline, verify data looks correct

### **Afternoon (1 PM - 5 PM):**
- Meeting with Data Analyst: "We need customer purchase history for a new dashboard"
- Design solution: Which tables to use? How to join them? How often to update?
- Write SQL - Python transformation logic
- Test with sample data
- Deploy to development/production
- Write documentation

### **Late Afternoon:**
- Code review: Review teammate's pipeline code
- Write tests for new pipeline
- Update data quality checks
- Plan tomorrow's work

**Key Takeaway:** Mix of coding, debugging, meetings, and planning
