## **Lesson 1.7: What Makes a Good Data Engineer?**

### **Technical Skills (Can be learned):**
- ✅ SQL (absolute must)
- ✅ Python (or another programming language)
- ✅ Understanding of databases/Storages
- ✅ Cloud platforms (AWS/GCP/Azure)

### **Soft Skills (Equally important):**
- 🧩 **Problem-solving** (debugging broken pipelines)
- 🗣️ **Communication** (explaining technical issues to non-technical stakeholders)
- 📖 **Documentation** (writing clear README files)
- 🤝 **Collaboration** (working with analysts, scientists, product teams)
- 📚 **Continuous learning** (tech changes fast)

### **Mindset:**
- 🔍 Curiosity ("Why did this fail? How can I prevent it?")
- 🏗️ Building for scale (thinking about what happens when data grows 10x)
- 🛡️ Data quality obsession (garbage in = garbage out)

**Good news:** You don't need a CS degree. You need dedication and practice.
