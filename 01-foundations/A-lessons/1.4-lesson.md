## **Lesson 1.4: Batch vs Streaming**

### **Two Primary Ways to Process Data:**

#### **Batch Processing**
**What it is:** Processing data in large chunks at scheduled intervals

**Real-world analogy:** 
Doing laundry once a week (you collect dirty clothes all week, then wash everything on Sunday)

**Examples:**
- Nightly sales reports (process all of yesterday's transactions at midnight)
- Monthly payroll (calculate everyone's salary at month-end)
- Daily email digest (send one email with all updates from the last 24 hours)

**Characteristics:**
- ⏰ Scheduled (every hour, daily, weekly)
- 📦 Processes lots of data at once
- 💰 More cost-effective
- ⏳ Some delay is acceptable

#### **Streaming Processing**
**What it is:** Processing data in real-time as it arrives

**Real-world analogy:**
Washing dishes right after using them (clean each plate immediately)

**Examples:**
- Fraud detection (flag suspicious transactions instantly)
- Uber driver matching (process ride requests in seconds)
- Stock trading alerts (notify when price hits target)
- Live sports scores

**Characteristics:**
- ⚡ Immediate (milliseconds to seconds)
- 🔄 Continuous processing
- 💸 More expensive infrastructure
- 🚨 Used when delays are unacceptable

### **When to Use Which?**

| Use Batch When... | Use Streaming When... |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Delays are acceptable (reports can wait hours) | Immediate action required (fraud alerts) |
| Processing large volumes efficiently | Real-time user experience matters |
| Historical analysis | Live monitoring |
| Cost is a concern | Speed is critical |

**Most companies use BOTH:**
- Batch for nightly reports, data warehouse updates
- Streaming for user-facing features, monitoring
