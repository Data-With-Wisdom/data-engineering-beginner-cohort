# **Activity 1: Spot the Data Engineering**

---

### **Part 1: Scenario**

"Let's look at something you probably know..."

**Scenario: Ordering Food on Glovo**

```
You open app → See restaurants → Order jollof rice → Track your driver → Food arrives
```

---

### **Part 2: Questions**

1. **"What information does the app collect about you?"**

2. **"Where does that information go after you click 'Order'?"**

3. **"How does the driver know where you are?"**

---

### **Part 3: Connecting to Data Engineering**

**Write on board:**

```
YOU → App → DATABASE → Driver's App
      ↓
   Your order is saved
      ↓
   Driver gets notified
      ↓
   You track in real-time
```

Everything you just described - collecting data, storing it, moving it to the driver, updating your tracking screen - **that's what Data Engineers build!**.

**Key points:**
- ✅ Data Engineers built the database that saves your order
- ✅ They built the system that sends notifications to the restaurant
- ✅ They built the real-time tracking feature
- ✅ They make sure it all works even when 10,000 people order at once
