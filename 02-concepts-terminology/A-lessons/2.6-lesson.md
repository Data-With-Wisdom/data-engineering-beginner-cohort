## **Lesson 2.6: Data Modeling Basics**

### **What is Data Modeling?**

**Definition:** Designing how data is organized in tables and how tables relate to each other

**Think of it as:** Creating a blueprint for your database (like architectural plans for a house)

---

### **Core Concepts:**

### **1. Tables**

**What they are:** Organized collections of related data

**Example: customers table**
```
customer_id | name    | email              | city
101         | Ahmed   | ahmed@email.com    | Lagos
102         | Chioma  | chioma@email.com   | Abuja
```

Each **row** = one customer  
Each **column** = one attribute

---

### **2. Primary Key**

**What it is:** A unique identifier for each row

**Rules:**
- Must be unique
- Cannot be null
- Never changes

**Example:**
```
customer_id is the primary key
→ Each customer has a unique ID
→ No two customers can have ID 101
```

---

### **3. Foreign Key**

**What it is:** A column that references another table's primary key

**Purpose:** Creates relationships between tables

**Example:**

**orders table:**
```
order_id | customer_id | product    | price
5001     | 101         | Laptop     | 250000
5002     | 101         | Mouse      | 5000
5003     | 102         | Keyboard   | 15000
```

Here, `customer_id` is a **foreign key** referencing `customers.customer_id`

**This means:**
- Order 5001 belongs to customer 101 (Ahmed)
- Order 5003 belongs to customer 102 (Chioma)

### **Visual Relationship:**

```
customers table              orders table
├── customer_id (PK) ←───────── customer_id (FK)
├── name                     ├── order_id (PK)
├── email                    ├── product
└── city                     └── price
```
