# **Module 2: The Language of Data Engineering (Week 2)**

## **Lesson 2.1: Data Lifecycle Deep Dive**

**Story:**
"Imagine you post a photo on Instagram. What happens to that photo? Where does it go? How does Instagram show it to your followers? Let's trace the journey of data from birth to retirement."

### **The Complete Data Lifecycle:**

```
GENERATION → INGESTION → STORAGE → TRANSFORMATION → SERVING → ARCHIVAL
```

Think of it like a **product manufacturing process:**
- Raw materials arrive (Generation)
- Factory receives them (Ingestion)
- Materials stored in warehouse (Storage)
- Assembled into products (Transformation)
- Shipped to stores (Serving)
- Old inventory moved to clearance (Archival)

---

### **Stage 1: GENERATION (Data is Created)**

**What happens:** Data comes into existence

**Real-world examples:**
- You click "Buy Now" on Jumia
- Temperature sensor records 28°C
- Your smartwatch counts 5,000 steps
- Someone tweets about #Lagos traffic
- A payment card is swiped

**Key point:** Data is created by actions, sensors, or events

---

### **Stage 2: INGESTION (Data is Collected/Captured)**

**What happens:** Systems capture and receive the data

**How it happens:**
- **APIs** (app sends data to server)
- **Event tracking** (website logs your clicks)
- **IoT sensors** (temperature data sent every minute)
- **File uploads** (you upload a document)
- **Database inserts** (new customer record added)

**Example:**
```
You post Instagram photo
   ↓
Phone app sends photo to Instagram servers via API
   ↓
Data ingested into Instagram's system
```

**Data Engineer's role:** Build the systems that reliably capture data (even during peak times)

---

### **Stage 3: STORAGE (Data is Saved)**

**What happens:** Data is persisted so it's not lost

**Where it's stored:**
- **Databases** (for structured, frequently accessed data)
- **Data Lakes** (for raw data, everything dumped here)
- **Object Storage** (S3 for files, images, videos)

**Example:**
```
Your Instagram photo
   ↓
Image file → Stored in Amazon S3
Photo metadata (likes, comments) → Stored in database
```

**Why multiple storage?** Different data types need different homes

---

### **Stage 4: TRANSFORMATION (Data is Cleaned & Processed)**

**What happens:** Raw data becomes useful data

**Common transformations:**
- **Cleaning** (remove duplicates, fix typos)
- **Standardizing** (convert all dates to same format)
- **Enriching** (add calculated fields like "total_price = quantity × unit_price")
- **Aggregating** (sum daily sales into monthly totals)
- **Joining** (combine customer data with order data)

**Example:**
```
Raw Instagram data:
user_id: 123, timestamp: 1706702400, action: "like"

After transformation:
user_name: "Ahmed", date: "2025-01-31", action: "liked photo", 
photo_owner: "Chioma", engagement_type: "positive"
```

**Data Engineer's role:** Write ETL/ELT pipelines to transform data automatically

---

### **Stage 5: SERVING (Data is Made Available)**

**What happens:** Transformed data is delivered to end users

**Who uses it:**
- **Analysts** query data warehouse for reports
- **Data Scientists** pull data for ML models
- **Dashboards** display real-time metrics
- **Applications** use data to personalize user experience

**Example:**
```
Instagram's "Explore" page
   ↓
Uses your transformed data (what you like, who you follow)
   ↓
Serves personalized recommendations
```

**Formats served:**
- SQL queries
- APIs
- CSV exports
- Parquet
- Avro
- Dashboard visualizations

---

### **Stage 6: ARCHIVAL (Old Data is Stored Long-Term)**

**What happens:** Data no longer actively used but kept for compliance or history

**Why archive:**
- **Legal requirements** (keep financial records for 7 years)
- **Historical analysis** (analyze trends over decades)
- **Cost savings** (move to cheaper storage)

**Example:**
```
Your Instagram posts from 5 years ago
   ↓
Still accessible but moved to cheaper storage
   ↓
Not in main database, retrieved only if needed
```

**Storage tiers:**
- Hot storage (frequently accessed) - Expensive
- Warm storage (occasionally accessed) - Medium cost
- Cold storage (rarely accessed) - Cheap

---

### **Visual Summary - Instagram Photo Journey:**

```
1. GENERATION: You take a photo
2. INGESTION: App uploads it via API
3. STORAGE: Photo → S3, Metadata → Database
4. TRANSFORMATION: Resize photo, extract hashtags, analyze content
5. SERVING: Followers see it in their feed, search by hashtag works
6. ARCHIVAL: After 2 years, moved to cheaper storage
```
