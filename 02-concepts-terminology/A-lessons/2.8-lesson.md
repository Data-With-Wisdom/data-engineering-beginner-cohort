## **Lesson 2.8: Pipelines & Orchestration (Conceptual)**

### **What is a Data Pipeline?**

**Definition:** Automated series of steps that move and transform data

**Think of it as:** Assembly line in a factory
- Raw materials enter
- Go through multiple stations
- Final product comes out

---

### **Simple Pipeline Example:**

```
Step 1: Extract data from PostgreSQL
   ↓
Step 2: Clean data (remove duplicates)
   ↓
Step 3: Transform (calculate totals)
   ↓
Step 4: Load into Snowflake
```

**Key point:** This runs automatically (daily, hourly, etc.) without manual intervention

---

### **What is Orchestration?**

**Definition:** Managing when and in what order pipeline tasks run

**Think of it as:** Air traffic control
- Ensures planes (tasks) take off in right order
- Monitors if delays occur
- Reroutes if problems arise

---

### **Orchestration Tool Example: Apache Airflow**

**What it does:**
```
Schedule: "Run this pipeline every day at 2 AM"
   ↓
Monitor: "Did it succeed? If not, alert the team"
   ↓
Dependencies: "Task B can only run after Task A completes"
   ↓
Retry logic: "If Task C fails, retry 3 times before giving up"
```

---

### **Why Orchestration Matters:**

**Without orchestration:**
```
You manually run:
python extract_data.py
python clean_data.py
python load_data.py

→ Tedious, error-prone, doesn't scale
```

**With orchestration:**
```
Define workflow once in Airflow
   ↓
Runs automatically forever
   ↓
You get alerts only if something breaks
```

---

### **Key Concepts (Don't worry about implementation yet):**

1. **DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph):** Visual representation of pipeline steps and dependencies
2. **Scheduling:** When tasks run (cron expressions: daily, hourly, etc.)
3. **Monitoring:** Tracking success/failure
4. **Retry logic:** What to do when tasks fail

**You'll learn tools like Airflow in advanced courses - for now, just understand the concept**
