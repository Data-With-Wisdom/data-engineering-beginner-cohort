## **Lesson 2.4: Common Data Formats**

### **Why Formats Matter:**
"Same data, different packaging. Each format has trade-offs."

---

### **1. CSV (Comma-Separated Values)**

**What it looks like:**
```csv
customer_id,name,email,total_spend
101,Ahmed,ahmed@email.com,45000
102,Chioma,chioma@email.com,67000
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Human-readable
- ✅ Works everywhere (Excel, databases, Python)
- ✅ Simple

**Cons:**
- ❌ No data types (everything is text until parsed)
- ❌ Large file sizes
- ❌ No schema enforcement

**When to use:** Small datasets, sharing data with non-technical users, quick exports

---

### **2. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)**

**What it looks like:**
```json
{
  "customer_id": 101,
  "name": "Ahmed",
  "email": "ahmed@email.com",
  "orders": [
    {"product": "Laptop", "price": 250000},
    {"product": "Mouse", "price": 5000}
  ]
}
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Flexible (nested data)
- ✅ Human-readable
- ✅ Standard for APIs

**Cons:**
- ❌ Larger than binary formats
- ❌ Slower to parse than binary

**When to use:** API responses, configuration files, web data

---

### **3. Parquet**

**What it is:** Columnar binary format (optimized for analytics)

**What it looks like:** Binary file (can't read directly, need tools)

**How it works:**
```
Instead of storing row by row:
Row 1: Ahmed, 28, Lagos
Row 2: Chioma, 34, Abuja

Stores column by column:
Names: [Ahmed, Chioma]
Ages: [28, 34]
Cities: [Lagos, Abuja]
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Very fast for analytics (read only columns you need)
- ✅ Excellent compression
- ✅ Stores data types

**Cons:**
- ❌ Not human-readable
- ❌ Slower for row-by-row operations

**When to use:** Data warehouses, big data processing (Spark), analytics workloads

---

### **4. Avro**

**What it is:** Row-based binary format with schema

**Characteristics:**
- Schema embedded in file
- Good for streaming data
- Compact and fast

**Pros:**
- ✅ Schema evolution (can change schema over time)
- ✅ Compact
- ✅ Good for Kafka streams

**Cons:**
- ❌ Not human-readable
- ❌ Less common than Parquet

**When to use:** Streaming pipelines, Kafka, schema evolution needed

---

### **Format Comparison:**

| Format | Type | Size | Speed | Human-Readable | Best For |
|--------|------|------|-------|----------------|----------|
| **CSV** | Text | Large | Slow | ✅ Yes | Small data, sharing |
| **JSON** | Text | Large | Slow | ✅ Yes | APIs, nested data |
| **Parquet** | Binary | Small | Fast (analytics) | ❌ No | Data warehouses, analytics |
| **Avro** | Binary | Small | Fast (streaming) | ❌ No | Kafka, streaming |

---

### **Rule of Thumb:**

```
Sharing with humans → CSV or JSON
Analytics in warehouse → Parquet
Streaming data → Avro
API responses → JSON
```
