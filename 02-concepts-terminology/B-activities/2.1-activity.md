# **Activity: Trace a Data Lifecycle (10 min)**

## **Scenario: Your Bank - Money Transfer**

**Instructions:**
"You transfer ₦50,000 from your account to a friend using your mobile banking app. Let's trace this data through all 6 lifecycle stages."

---

### **Work in pairs and answer:**

1. **GENERATION:** What data is created when you initiate the transfer?

2. **INGESTION:** How does the bank capture this data?

3. **STORAGE:** Where is this data saved?

4. **TRANSFORMATION:** What processing happens to this data?

5. **SERVING:** Who uses this data and how?

6. **ARCHIVAL:** What happens to old transaction data?

<!---

## **Example Answer (Guide for Discussion):**

### **1. GENERATION (Data is Created)**
```
You open banking app and initiate transfer:
- Your account number: 1234567890
- Friend's account number: 0987654321
- Amount: ₦50,000
- Transfer date/time: 2025-01-31 14:30:00
- Your device info: Android phone, Lagos location
- Transaction type: "Transfer"
```

---

### **2. INGESTION (Data is Captured)**
```
Mobile app → Sends encrypted data via API
   ↓
Bank's server receives request
   ↓
Data logged: Who, what, when, where, how much
   ↓
Real-time fraud check initiated
```

**How captured:**
- API call from mobile app to bank server
- Data transmitted in real-time (not batch)

---

### **3. STORAGE (Data is Saved)**
```
Multiple storage systems:

Operational Database (PostgreSQL/Oracle):
- Account balances (updated immediately)
- Transaction record (saved permanently)
  
Data Lake (Amazon S3):
- Raw transaction logs
- Mobile app usage data
- Security/fraud detection logs

Data Warehouse (Snowflake/Teradata):
- Historical transactions (for analysis)
- Customer transaction patterns
```

**Why multiple storage?**
- Database: Fast access for account balance
- Lake: Cheap storage for all raw data
- Warehouse: Analytics (spending patterns, fraud detection)

---

### **4. TRANSFORMATION (Data is Processed)**
```
Immediate transformations:
- Deduct ₦50,000 from your account
- Add ₦50,000 to friend's account
- Check: Do you have sufficient balance?
- Generate transaction reference number
- Calculate any fees

Nightly batch transformations:
- Aggregate: Your total spending today
- Categorize: "Transfer" transaction type
- Calculate: Monthly spending vs last month
- Fraud scoring: Is this unusual activity?

Weekly transformations:
- Load into data warehouse
- Join with customer profile data
- Calculate customer analytics
```

---

### **5. SERVING (Data is Made Available)**
```
Different users access transformed data:

You (Customer):
- See transaction in app history immediately
- Get SMS/email confirmation
- View updated balance

Bank Analysts:
- Query data warehouse: "How many transfers happened today?"
- Dashboard: Real-time transaction volumes
- Reports: Monthly transaction trends by region

Fraud Team:
- ML model flags suspicious patterns
- Alert if transfer is unusual for your profile

Regulators:
- Annual reports on transaction volumes
- Compliance data (anti-money laundering checks)

Marketing Team:
- Analyze: "Customers who transfer frequently also use savings features"
- Personalized offers based on behavior
```

---

### **6. ARCHIVAL (Old Data is Stored Long-Term)**
```
Transaction data older than 7 years:
   ↓
Moved from expensive data warehouse
   ↓
To cheaper cold storage (Amazon Glacier)
   ↓
Still accessible if needed (legal/audit requirements)
   ↓
Retrieved only for special requests

Why archive:
- Legal requirement: Keep financial records 7-10 years
- Cost savings: Cold storage is 10x cheaper
- Rare access: Nobody needs your 2015 transactions daily

## **Discussion Questions (After Activity):**

1. **"Why does the bank store the same transaction in multiple places?"**
   <!-- - Answer: Different purposes (operations vs analytics vs compliance) -->

2. **"What's the difference between the data in STORAGE vs SERVING?"**
   <!-- - Answer: Storage = raw/intermediate, Serving = processed/ready-to-use -->

3. **"Is this batch or streaming processing?"**
   <!-- - Answer: Hybrid (real-time for transaction, batch for analytics) -->
